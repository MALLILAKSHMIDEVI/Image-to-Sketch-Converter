Image to Sketch Converter
This is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload images and convert them into sketch-like representations. The application provides options for adjusting sketch parameters and supports various image formats for enhanced flexibility.

Key Requirements:
Develop a GUI using Python's tkinter library: Create an intuitive interface for image upload and sketch conversion.
Implement image-to-sketch conversion algorithms: Use libraries like OpenCV or PIL to process uploaded images and generate sketch-like outputs.
Provide options for adjusting sketch parameters: Allow users to customize line thickness, contrast, brightness, and other artistic effects.
Support multiple image formats: Ensure compatibility with common image processing libraries for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
Include preview functionality: Allow users to preview the converted sketch before saving it.
Implement saving options: Provide options to save the converted sketches in various image formats for further editing or sharing purposes.
Ensure efficient error handling: Handle issues such as unsupported image formats, processing errors, or invalid inputs during the conversion process.
Solution Overview:
GUI Design:
Create a user-friendly interface with buttons for image upload, sketch conversion, parameter adjustment sliders, preview area, and save options.

Image Processing:
Implement image processing functions using OpenCV or PIL to convert uploaded images into sketch-like representations based on selected parameters.

Sketch Parameter Adjustment:
Provide sliders or input fields for users to adjust parameters like line thickness, contrast, brightness, and artistic effects to customize the sketch output.

Image Format Support:
Ensure that the application supports common image formats for uploading images and saving converted sketches to maintain compatibility with user workflows.

Preview and Save Functionality:
Include preview functionality to display the converted sketch before saving. Implement options to save the sketch in various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) based on user preferences.

Usage:
To use the Image to Sketch Converter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (tkinter, opencv-python, etc.).
Run the Python script (image_to_sketch_converter.py).
Upload an image, adjust the sketch parameters, preview the sketch, and save it as desired.
